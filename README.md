## Rules of the game:
  1. The game has several levels on different topics.
  2. Initially, only two levels will be open, the rest will need to be opened for coins.
  3. Selecting a level will take you to the first question. You will have 2 minutes to complete it. And there will be 3 lives in total.
  4. If you answer incorrectly several times and you have few lives left, you can purchase them for coins.
  5. If you don't know the correct answer and don't want to lose a life, you can get a hint for coins.
  6. For each correct answer on the level, you get coins.
  7. And also with the passage of the entire level you will receive additional coins.
  8. Another way to get coins is to click on the plus next to the number of coins in the level and select a specific amount.
